## Overview and Origin  

One of the most popular Artificial intelligence companies is known as Open AI. Sam Altman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, and Greg Brockman started this company in 2015 to ensure that artificial general intelligence -AI systems generally smarter than humans- benefits all of humanity. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/about))
While we know that AI technology has been among us for a while in various forms, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer series called ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, made artificial intelligence a household topic of discussion. "ChatGPT was released in November 2022, and became the most popular chatbot and generative AI tool–for producing anything from chatbot responses to survey questions to resumes." ([Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-openai))


## Business Activities 
The company has gone through major ups and downs since its inception. The world is curious and skeptical about AI technology, and everything that OpenAI does is being looked at very closely. Being the most popular in the AI industry for now, OpenAI is under constant scrutiny. At the beginning of 2024, the company was in the news headlines because of its structure. OpenAI started as a non-profit company; however, due to the rigid structure of the non-profit model, the company had to pivot and create a structure that helped it raise funds. “We’ve created OpenAI LP, a new “capped-profit” company that allows us to rapidly increase our investments in computing and talent while including checks and balances to actualize our mission.” ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp)) While this change happened in 2019, its impact led to one of the most controversial events in the company's history. The sitting board decided to oust the CEO, Sam Altman, stating leadership issues. However, other company employees threatened to resign if Sam Altman was not reinstated. This pushed the board to reassess their decision, and the company was able to make the necessary amendments and get back to doing their work. This incident has helped the company extensively. As of February 2024, the OpenAI value has increased significantly."OpenAI has completed a deal that values the San Francisco artificial intelligence company at $80 billion or more, nearly tripling its valuation in less than ten months, according to three people with knowledge of the deal." ([Metz & Mickle](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/16/technology/openai-artificial-intelligence-deal-valuation.html))   

The company researches, develops, and deploys AI technologies across various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, reinforcement learning, robotics, and AI ethics. By advancing the state of the art in AI and developing innovative AI solutions, OpenAI aims to create beneficial and impactful AI applications that benefit society while addressing ethical and safety considerations. ([OpenAI](https://openai.com/about))
The various focus areas give OpenAI advantages to offer unique solutions to organizations such as enterprises, businesses, developers, researchers, government, and non-profit agencies. However, the market segment can grow enormously as the advancement and adoption of the technology increases. The company’s unfair advantage lies in its cutting-edge research, access to advanced AI models, commitment to ethics, developer-friendly tools, community engagement, and substantial resources. This unique blend enables OpenAI to offer solutions that stand out in the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. "OpenAI provides a competitive advantage by enabling quicker decision-making through data analysis, rapid content generation, and efficient customer service. This ability allows businesses to respond to market changes and customer demands swiftly. " ([AlanC](https://www.valuecoders.com/blog/ai-ml/openai-in-business-benefits-and-uses/#:~:text=Competitive%20Edge%3A&text=OpenAI%20provides%20a%20competitive%20advantage,changes%20and%20customer%20demands%20swiftly.))

OpenAI products are out in the market and are being used worldwide. ChatGpt, DALL-E-2, Codex, Whisper, Scholar, OpenAI GYM, and OpenAI API are some products. The company applies various technologies; some of the key technologies they are using are deep learning, transformers, reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, AI ethics and safety, large-scale computing infrastructure, and natural language processing tools. OpenAI implements these technologies through research, experimentation, software development, and collaboration with academic and industry partners. Their work spans various AI applications, from language understanding and generation to robotics and reinforcement learning.

## Landscape
The artificial intelligence industry is growing year by year. In the past 5 to 10 years, the industry has seen technological innovation and increased investments in AI companies. "The fifth edition of Deloitte’s State of AI in the Enterprise reported 94% of business leaders believe AI is critical to their success strategy over the next five years. The generative AI market is expected to double every other year for the next ten years; investments are soaring, and consumers are largely driving adoption." ([B.Sniderman,D.Kearns-manolatos,N.Mittal](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/topics/digital-transformation/companies-investing-in-ai-to-generate-value.html?id=us:2ps:3gl:digenai24:awa:di:011024:ai%20companies:b:c:kwd-298958182465&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA_tuuBhAUEiwAvxkgTsOOL3sXLwPOnkW-SAxWAlh-8NPpANjZdNERhMv5RSmdzXvcHTaMExoCpE8QAvD_BwE))

With rapid advancement, companies and research institutions have made progress in developing self-driving cars, drones, robotic manipulators, and mobile robots for applications in transportation, logistics, healthcare, and manufacturing. While the advanced innovations add to the development of our society, they also raise many questions about the misuse of these technologies. There has been a significant focus on research and development of AI ethics frameworks, fairness, transparency, interpretability, accountability, and AI safety mechanisms to ensure AI systems behave ethically, align with human values, and mitigate potential risks. One major focus for OpenAI is research on safety and alignment."Our alignment research aims to make artificial general intelligence (AGI) aligned with human values and follow human intent. We take an iterative, empirical approach: by attempting to align highly capable AI systems, we can learn what works and what doesn’t, thus refining our ability to make AI systems safer and more aligned."([OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research))

## Results  
OpenAI has had a substantial business impact by advancing the state of the art in artificial intelligence, influencing industry practices, enabling the development of AI-powered products and services, fostering collaboration and partnerships, and contributing to the growth of the AI ecosystem. Due to the popularity that OpenAI has brought to the industry, now there is significant competition in this field. Companies such as Google, Meta Platform, Microsoft, Amazon, Apple, IBM, and NVIDIA are working to advance AI technology and have launched products similar to OpenAI products.

## Recommendations
As someone learning about AI and impacted by AI, I see the potential in using new technologies to build solutions. If we can build responsible AI technologies, we can utilize this resource to implement changes that can help us nurture ideas leading the world toward a better, more positive future. OpenAI claims to be working for the betterment of humanity by focusing on building responsible AI. With that in mind, here are my few research topic recommendations that could help OpenAi achieve the company's mission.  

Project 1: Rapid Process Improvements Solutions for systems that impact day-to-day lives. 
Some significant issues are public systems and processes within education, healthcare, agriculture, housing, labor, tax, etc. How can we make these systems function better? Can AI analyze the data available to look for pain points and improvement opportunities in the current generational old systems and processes to suggest effective and influential solutions to improve their function? These systems and processes, if made better, can significantly impact the progress as a collective. We use these systems and processes day in and day out. Therefore, we must find ways to make them efficient and not tedious and nerve-racking. 

Project 2: Another area of research can be answering questions that can help us find solutions to elevate collective well-being. The Post-pandemic world is different; people's perspectives towards life and the world around them have changed significantly. People are more conscious of their well-being and how they live, work, and connect. The world is different. The generation who grew up along with technology - millennials and Gen Z are demanding more regarding how technology is being utilized. This generation is aware of the capabilities of technology in making life easier; however, they are now interested in utilizing technology for the better. This generation seeks solutions to bring meaningful changes and drive positive impact.” Millennials and Gen Zs are taking action to drive the change they want to see in the world. They are becoming more politically involved, making a conscious effort to ensure they spend their money with companies that reflect their values and pushing for change on societal issues. They believe in their power to make a difference but demand that businesses and governments do their part to help build a better future.” ([Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/deloitte/2021/07/22/for-millennials-and-gen-zs-social-issues-are-top-of-mind-heres-how-organizations-can-drive-meaningful-change/?sh=2db2623f450c))

OpenAI can use extensive research through deep learning and pattern recognition to understand the needs of today’s generation and propose solutions that cater to those needs accordingly.
